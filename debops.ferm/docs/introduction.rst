Introduction
============

`ferm`_ is a wrapper around ``iptables`` and ``ip6tables`` commands which lets
you manage host firewall in an easy and Ansible-friendly way. This role can
be used to setup firewall rules directly from inventory, or it can be used
as a dependency by other roles to setup firewall rules for other services.
